# 22.12.5---Quiz-Challenge


## Learned

Going back and working on this it is nice to see that there are number of things where I see multiple ways that something could be done. Whether it is with the HTML or storing QA pairs or storing answers or even store high scores, need to get those added. 

## Issues

My initial plan had been do have the questions randomly chosen and presented. I wasn't able to do this though it did take quite a bit of my time and led to me not being able to submit initially. I am slowly but surely learning the importance of putting together a MVP that is ready to go. 

If I delay on selecting the start button after a game has been ended the seconds counter doesn't always reset to the 30 seconds as it is suppose to do. I don't see this problem if I quickly move through the prompts.
